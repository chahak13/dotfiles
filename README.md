# dotfiles

This repository will contain all the dotfiles that I use for my working setup. The aim for doing this is to maintain a portable configuration that can be set up on any machine.

## TODO:

- [ ] Configure zsh better, and add helpful aliases
- [x] Configure local files to add/override functionality (especially zsh)
- [ ] Add screenshots
- [x] Add Hammerspoon
