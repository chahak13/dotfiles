# wm independent hotkeys
#

# With the introduction of emacs in my setup, I'm trying out a new
# set of hotkeys that follow a certain mnemonic. Since I'm not sure
# how hard they will be on my hands, these keysets are going to be 
# under review for the time being. Furthermore, I plan to use the
# super key in my emacs bindings and hence am moving all the BSPWM
# bindings to the `hyper` key (mod3).

# Mnemonics:
# o group - open programs
#   t - terminal
#   e - editor of choice (currently emacs)
#   f - firefox
#   s - surf (Opens duckduckgo.com)
#   r - rofi
#   d - dmenu

# p group - powermenu operations
#   s - shutdown
#   r - reboot
#   l - lockscreen

# Since terminal and emacs are my go-to keybindings, I've also bound them
# to slightly easier bindings:
   
#    terminal - hyper + Return
#    emacs    - hyper + e

# hyper + o; {t, e, f, s, r, d}
#     { \
#     kitty ,\
#     emacsclient --create-frame --alternate-editor="",\
#     firefox ,\
#     surf "duckduckgo.com",\
#     rofi -combi-modi window,drun,run,ssh,keys -show combi -modi combi -show-icons,\
#     dmenu_run \
#     }
